# MNISTcpp

My implementation of different methods for image recognition in C++ 

### The goal is to impletment from scratch some of the simpliest methods of machine learning applied to an easy problem : MNIST digit recognition.

- Logistic Regression (O/1 for even and odd number) 
- Neural Network for classification 

### TO DO : 

- Convolutional Neural Network 
- 
- 

### Requierements

- Eigen/Dense for linear algebra
